</p>

###
- Upon launching the system, the user is presented with two options: login and registration.
- Below them, there is a "Use the app as a guest" button, which allows users who do not wish to provide their data to use the speed camera detection feature.

## Login

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/2.png" alt="Login window" width="300" height="450"/>
</p>

###
- The user can return to the home screen by pressing the arrow in the top right corner.
- A user with an account enters their login details: email and password.
- The password is hidden, but displayed when the "eye" icon is pressed.
- They press the "Login" button.
- If the credentials are entered correctly and the user exists, the login is successful; otherwise, appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Signup

<p align="center">

## Camera

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/4.png" alt="Camera window" width="300" height="450"/>
</p>

###
- In the "Camera" window, speed cameras are detected with the help of a smart device.
 - The left button "Turn on camera" activates the camera, along with the object detection model on the server.
- The right button "Turn on camera" activates the camera, along with the object detection model on the computer (locally).
- Once the camera is activated, the buttons are hidden, and the view from the device's camera is displayed, along with the already functioning speed camera detection.
- P.S. How images are detected from the server will be demonstrated during the defense, as it is very costly to keep it turned on.

## Detected Speed Cameras

## Video

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/10.png" alt="video" width="300" height="450"/>
</p>

###
- An additional feature has been added that allows for the detection of speed camera signs and alerts from video recordings.
- The user presses on the desired video recording to play it.
- Users can add and remove video recordings.

## Speed camera detection

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/11.png" alt="Speed camera detection" width="300" height="450"/>
</p>

###
- The speed sign recognition window from the video recording is displayed. The camera window looks exactly the same, but it includes a bottom navigation menu.
- Contours are drawn around the detected sign, based on the coordinates received from the object detection model.

## Alert message

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/12.png" alt="Alert message" width="300" height="200"/>
</p>

###
- This is how the visual notification appears to the user upon recognizing an average speed camera sign, which informs about an average speed camera installed on the current section of the road.
